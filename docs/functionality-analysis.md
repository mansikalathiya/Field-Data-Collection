### What's a functionality analysis?

In the UX field a functionality analysis is simply an analysis of similar functionality to what will be in your product. Analyzing pieces of functionality that already exist in the world, allows us to see what works and what doesn't. And seeing this allows us to learn from mistakes that were made, making for a better product on our end.


### Pieces of Functionality
 
For our analysis we wanted to see how other apps did the following:

- Add Data / Information
- View nearby POIs (what the initial view was on map products)
- Search
- Downloading offline maps
- Long forms

We analyzed a good number of apps everything from Google maps to Airbnb, from Maps.me to Uber. Here is what we came up with: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_yr-2BK1iafnX_H3b3IiS84Q1Qd859p9sJb28chDFM/edit?usp=sharing
